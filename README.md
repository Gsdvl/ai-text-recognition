# AI Text Recognition  
Machine Learning Project to Differentiate Human-Made Texts from Texts Generated by Large Language Models  

## Intention and Motivation  
This repository is part of the final project for the **Machine Learning Ops (IMD 1123)** discipline at the **Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte**.  

We were inspired by the Kaggle competition [LLM - Detect AI Generated Text](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text/data).  
The goal of this project is to develop an algorithm capable of distinguishing between human-written text and text generated by large language models (LLMs).  
This tool aims to support educators and evaluators in verifying the authenticity of essays submitted by students or candidates.  

## Dataset  
*Currently under evaluation.*  

## Modules  
*Work in progress.*  

The project will consist of the following modules:  
- **Notebooks**: To document experimentation and results obtained with datasets and models.  
- **Scripts**: To implement functional components, including CI/CD processes, ensuring the model's training and performance are maintained during deployment.
